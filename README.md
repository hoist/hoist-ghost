# Hoist Theme

Theme for [Hoist Blog](https://www.hoist.io/blog).

## Getting started

Either clone this repo, or download it as a zip. Drop the whole folder into your ghost installation, inside /content/themes. Then login to ghost, and change your theme to hoist-ghost.

All the css is generated in assets/Sass/screen.scss. If you want to compile the scss run the [gulpfile](http://gulpjs.com/).

###Things to Configure

You will probably want to configure the email signup form, or remove it. We personally use [Campaign Monitor](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/), but it can be configured to use whatever you want. The two places you'll want to configure are found in post.hbs and default.hbs.

You'll also need to bring your own [Typekit](https://typekit.com/) account. The fonts we use are [Expo Serif Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/expo-serif-pro), and [Proxima Nova](https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova). Add your embed code in default.hbs, in the head. Alternativly, you could edit the css to use free fonts.

We use google analytics to monitor our blog, add your tracking code to default.hbs, in the script tag just before the closing body tag.

If you want to edit the sidebar, for example adding tag links or a description, look inside default.hbs, in the sidebar element.

###Using theme elements

Too add a "discuss this article on twitter" call to action in the footer, simply add

    <div id="twitter" data-link="https://twitter.com/hoistapps/status/557665010806452225"></div>

Anywhere in the post, the element gets hidden automatically and the button is revealed thanks to assets/js/index.js

Too add a code block with highlight syntaxing, start a fenced code block like this

    ```language-javascript
    var SupportedLaguages = [
      "markup","css","css-extras",
      "javascript","java",
      "php","scss","c","c++",
      "python","ruby","csharp",
      "go","swift","git","less",
      "r","haml"
    ];
    ```
Change the language-javascript to any of those supported languages, for example use language-css, or language-markup (for html).

We hope you enjoy our theme, if you use it please show us! @hoistapps on twitter.
